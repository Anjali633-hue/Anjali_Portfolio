# TOPIC: KT - PSEUDOINVEX MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONTROL PROBLEM
In this dissertation, we have reviewed a manuscript entitled “KT-pseudoinvex multidimensional control problem”. In which the definition of KT-pseudoinvexity is introduced. Also, under the hypothesis of KT- pseudoinvexity over the functionals involved, an equivalent relation between all the KT- points and the optimal solutions of multidimensional scalar control problem (MCP) is established. Consequently, it has been given that the class of invex functionals is equivalent to the class of pseudoinvex functionals. Moreover, an application has been used to numerically illustrate the theoretical results.
